# Last Tab Button for Firefox

Adds a button to the tabstrip to switch to the last accessed tab.

There are other extensions that do the same, but they use complex code, storing their own history of tabs. There's no need to reinvent the wheel, when Firefox already does that.
This extension uses minimal code and only native Firefox functions to achieve the same result.
